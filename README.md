toying around with storing lego spike projects in github
dadbot2024.lms should open in the lego mindstorms app or in the spike education app, this project currently uses scratch so git integration is limited.  Once my kids are ready for python, there will be an effort to migrate to python.
This project is experimental, meaning that I'm going to try different things and likely break it, delete everything and start over... and a bunch of other stuff that means I make no promises that anything you pull down works without editing.

so all that said, it's for fun and learning!  I hope it helps or gives you some ideas.
